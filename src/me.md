## Favourite Tools

I use various tools for various jobs. So I will try to list them all, and what I use them for.

**Sublime Text 3**
:   My everyday text editor. I also normally use this for developing in Python, and any odd script I have.

**VIM**
:   I use this for any plain text editing, such as writing this website, markdown editing, editing my Bash/VIM scripts, and obviously also editing files on servers.

**Android Studio**
:   The best editor for android development, it has it's quircks but over all it is amazing.

**IntelliJ IDEA**
:   I use this for Scala and only Scala. (The pure IntelliJ IDEA version that is)

**Eclipse**
:   I use this for Java development, but only if I am making a large application, or don't know a library.
