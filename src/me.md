## Favourite Tools

**VIM**
:   I use this for any plain text editing, such as writing this website, markdown editing, editing my Bash/VIM scripts, and obviously also editing files on servers.

**Android Studio**
:   The best editor for android development, it has it's quircks but over all it is amazing.

**IntelliJ IDEA**
:   I use this for Scala and only Scala. (The pure IntelliJ IDEA version that is)
