# 0merlin.github.io

I have created this site using as much as possible (using my current knowledge) to use pandoc as far
as possible. However I have only scratched the surface of what I can do with it. So I will be adding
in the future.

## Copying

Everything on this site will be released under the MIT license, which means copy anything you want.
But I take no responsibility at all to what you copy. Any source code I show that is not mine I will
give the link to where I got it from. But I might make mistakes, if I do contact me and I will be happy
to update or remove.

## Source for CSS and things:

I now have only my own CSS, I have taken ideas from various other sites, but
the styling will be changing over time.
